The plugin works as follows within the correctly configured workflow:

* If the plugin has been called within the workflow, it runs through all images in the master folder and creates a new structure element for each image.
* However, if an image contains a sequence of letters defined in the configuration file in the file name, then this image is added to the last structure element.

## Configuration
The plugin is configured in the file `plugin_intranda_step_create_structure_from_filenames.xml` as shown here:
